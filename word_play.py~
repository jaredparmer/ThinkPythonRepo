""" solves the following Car Talk puzzler:

"I was driving on the highway the other day and I happened to notice my
odometer.  Like most odometers, it shows six digits, in whole miles only. 
So, if my car had 300,000 miles, for example, I'd see 3-0-0-0-0-0.

"Now, what I saw that day was very interesting. I noticed that the last 4
digits were palindromic; that is, they read the same forward as backward. 
For example, 5-4-4-5 is a palindrome, so my odometer could have read
3-1-5-4-4-5.

"One mile later, the last 5 numbers were palindromic. For example, it could 
have read 3-6-5-4-5-6.  One mile after that, the middle 4 out of 6 numbers 
were palindromic.  And you ready for this? One mile later, all 6 were 
palindromic!

"The question is, what was on the odometer when I first looked?"
